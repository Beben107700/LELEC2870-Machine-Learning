# LELEC2870 - Machine Learning
This repo contains Ben Delcoigne and Thomas Heuschlings machine learning project.

## Statement
We are given a database of 20k articles from Mashable. This database contains features about the article (number of reads, day of the week it was posted,...). Each article is associated to a number of shares on social media. Our mission is to generate an algorithm that predicts how many shares a new article will get

## Workflow
We must first select relevant features. Once that is done we can use different techniques. We start out with linear regression which as expected gives very bad results. We then used KNN and MLP. Finally, we could choose a method of choice.
